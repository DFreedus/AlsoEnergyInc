Concept or element that was unfamiliar or unexpected
	Implicit and Explicit - BlobIO.cs lines 53-54
		First time seeing these keywords in action.
	Unchecked - BinaryEx.cs line 31
		Unfamiliar with unchecked/checked keywords. Googled uses and examples.

Constructive review or recommended improvement
	The formatting on a lot of the methods seemed hard to follow.
		Reformatting to one statement per line, aside from simple "if (x) return;" 
	
	Code comments
		Sections of code commented out. Seemed some were to keep the code challenge lightweight
		and avoid having to include too many classes (ReflectEx). Others didn't have context to 
		explain the change, or why they were left in.

Opportunity or future enhancement
	Organizing classes (BlobIO.cs)
		Creating regions and organizing classes.
		Grouping methods by access modifiers and functionality 
		might make opportunities for optimization more apparent.
